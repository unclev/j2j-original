# j2j
J2J (Jabber-to-Jabber) is a XMPP gateway that allows to connect another XMPP accounts through it. It can be useful when you want to contact to people from some server which has no S2S support (ok.ru, for example) or when you want to use a second XMPP account but the client you are using can't do that.

Unlike the [new j2j](jbinary/j2j), this branch represents [the original component](http://jawiki.ru/Eng:J2J)'s svn://svn.jrudevels.org/j2j/trunk.
